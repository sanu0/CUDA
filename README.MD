## Examples and Code

This repository contains the following examples:

1.  **Hello, GPU:** A simple CUDA program that prints a message from the GPU.
    
2.  **Array Addition:** Performing element-wise addition using GPU threads.
    
3.  **Matrix Multiplication:** Optimizing matrix multiplication with shared memory.
    
4.  **Parallel Reductions:** Summing an array using parallel techniques.
    

Each example includes:

-   Source code (.cu files)
    
-   Comments explaining the concepts and implementation
